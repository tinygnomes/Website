# Project Knowledge Base Instructions

Hello, I am the AI assistant for this project. This is my knowledge base.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

1.  **Start Here:** Always begin by reviewing this file and the `product_overview.md` to understand the current high-level goals.
2.  **Follow Patterns:** Before writing new code, check the `patterns/` directory for established system patterns. Adhere to them strictly.
3.  **Consult Decisions:** Review the `decisions/` directory to understand the history and constraints of the project. Do not contradict an "Accepted" decision without a new ADR.
4.  **Create New Decisions:** If a significant architectural choice is needed, create a new file in `decisions/` using the ADR template. Ask for human review.
5.  **Use How-To Guides:** For common tasks like setup or deployment, follow the guides in `how-to/`.
6.  **Find and Track Work:** Consult `03_work_backlog.md` to see what tasks are prioritized. When you complete a task, update the file accordingly.
